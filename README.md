# 👩‍🎓 Kids Coding Curriculum

While there are resource lists related to this topic, I have not found any repositories that organize those resources into a structured, progressive curriculum tailored for actual teaching. This project will make a humble attempt to fill that gap a bit - especially for parents, homework helpers and volunteers who want to support kids to become confident creators with technology.

## 📚 Age-Based Tracks

### Ages 5–8: Visual & Creative Thinking

- Use block-based programming to build logic and storytelling skills
- Projects focus on creativity and interaction

### Ages 9–12: Fundamentals with Fun

- Move from blocks to real syntax using beginner-friendly tools
- Introduction to Python, logic, and interactive projects

### Teens: Building Real Things

- Web development, simple game dev, and basic data handling
- Encourage creative freedom and long-term projects
